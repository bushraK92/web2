                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <p>                    
The desire for more positive experience is itself a negative experience. And, paradoxically, the acceptance of one’s negative experience is itself a positive experience.
The more you pursue feeling better all the time, the less satisfied you become, as pursuing something only reinforces the fact that you lack it in the first place. Philosopher Alan Watts used to refer to as “The Backwards Law.”
Everything worthwhile in life is won through surmounting the associated negative experience.
To not give a f*ck is to stare down life’s most terrifying and difficult challenges and still take action.
When you give too many f*cks—when you give a f*ck about everyone and everything—you will feel that you’re perpetually entitled to be comfortable and happy at all times, that everything is supposed to be just exactly the f*cking way you want it to be.

                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <p>The Ikigai book introduces you to various topics related to the art of living, such as the blue zones, longevity, logotherapy, flow, yoga, tai chi, and resilience.
                     It defines what Ikigai is and its rules. The book says that living a long and full life is under your control to an extent.
                    Your habits and life choices can make a significant difference from an early age.
                 The authors of this book conducted 100 interviews in Ogimi, Okinawa (the world’s longest-living community) to gain an in-depth understanding of the longevity secrets of centenarians and supercentenarians.
                 Each chapter delivers a well-researched account of Okinawans’ lifestyle, attitude, mindset, diet, and routine. 
                 The authors argue that your Ikigai keeps your body fighting and living longer. </p>
